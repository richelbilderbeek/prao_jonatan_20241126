# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I treated Jonatan as an actual colleague with a challenge at the appropriate level.

## What I could do better

Unsure, everything went very smoothly. Maybe not have him in the UPPMAX meeting, but hey, meetings are part of the job too...

## My conclusion about Jonatan

I would encourage all future people that consider having Jonatan as a PRAO to take him: he has been working seriously, he always was on time, was able to work autonomously, a good listener and a friendly talker.
