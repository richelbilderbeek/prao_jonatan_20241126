# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I treated Jonatan as an actual colleague with a challenge at the appropriate level.

## What I could do better

- Make sure all 'Frans'es are replaced by 'Jonatan' in the repo
- Be clearer what is expected from the report

## My conclusion about Jonatan

I would encourage all future people that consider having Jonatan as a
PRAO to take him: he has been working seriously, he always was on time,
was able to work autonomously, a good listener and a friendly talker.
