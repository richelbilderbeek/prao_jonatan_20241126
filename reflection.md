# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
I coded a program comparing the time to calculate prime numbers with two methods and then plotting a graph out of the results.

## What did you do well?
I was focused during the day and managed to do a lot on my own.

## What can be improved?
I got pretty frustrated when things didn't work correctly and I didn't analyze the output properly, instead I made random changes hoping it would work, a lot of time could have been saved.

## What did you supervisor do well?
He was very passionate about what he did and explained things well.

## How can you supervisor be improved?
I think helping more with the code would have helped, I was encouraged to do most things on my own which was pretty hard.

## What would you do differently next time?
Not rush through the coding, taking my time analyzing it more instead.

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
Don't try to finish as fast as possible, take your time with it.
