# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?

## What did you do well?

## What can be improved?

## What did you supervisor do well?

## How can you supervisor be improved?

## What would you do differently next time?

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
